Hello, if you are reading this README.md file it is because, probably, you have just created an cells app project with a `helloworld scaffold` to develop on it.

For that you should must have installed cells-cli in a global way.

**cells-cli** is the command line tool that provides you with common tasks and commands for working in a cells project.

## Installation

To install the application just run:

~~~sh
npm -g install @cells/cells-cli
~~~

Once installed, `cells` command will be available to you.

## Usage

When you execute `cells` will result in a menu like this:

### <a name="app:create"></a>app:create

~~~
$ cells app:create
~~~

Creates the scaffolding of a Cells application.

The generator will ask you for the following:

? **Choose an App scaffold** (Answer by typing the choice number)
  1) Scaffold an example App based on Polymer 2 (Dynamic Pages)
  2) Scaffold an example App based on Polymer 2 (Declarative Pages)
  3) Scaffold an empty App based on Polymer 2 (Dynamic Pages)
  4) Scaffold an example App based on LitElement (Declarative Pages)

? **Do you want an E2E project to be created?** (Y/n) 

? **Choose mobile platforms if you want (Choosing one will create a mobile project)** (Answer by typing the choice number)

?**App name ...** 

The newly created application will create a folder taking the helloWorld template as scaffold  and will have the following structure:

~~~
project_name/
    .bowerrc
    .cellsrc
    .editorconfig
    .eslintignore
    .eslintrc.json

    components/
    mocks/
    node_modules/
    package.json
    package-lock.json
    sonar-project.properties
~~~

Parameters:
- **appName**: the name of the app to create. Required


### <a name="app:e2e"></a>app:e2e

~~~
$ cells app:e2e -u <url> -c <config_file>
~~~

Run the e2e tests with [Cell Pepino V1](https://platform.bbva.com/en-us/developers/engines/cells/documentation/testing/cells-pepino-v1-maintenance) legacy test runner on given url and given configuration file.

If you want to run e2e tests with [Cells Pepino V2](https://platform.bbva.com/en-us/developers/engines/cells/documentation/testing/cells-pepino-v2), you must install it as a dependency inside your e2e test project, and then, execute it from the root of your e2e project.

#### Installation (inside your e2e test project)

```shell
npm install @cells-pepino/cli
```

#### Execution (from the root of your e2e project)

```shell
./node_modules/@cells-pepino/cli/bin/cli.js -c ./config/wdio5.local.conf.js
```

or simply, through provided npm script in e2e scaffold project:

```shell
npm run test
```

Follow given documentation, and e2e project readme file for more information about how to do it.

__If you are going to run your e2e tests against a local application (you are hosting it in your local workspace), remember to serve it first__ - otherwise e2e test runner won't be able to run the tests against it - See more information about `cells app:serve` command above.

__REMEMBER! You must install all required npm dependencies first inside your E2E project__

```shell
npm install
```

Parameters:

- **url**: url for testing. Required
- **config_file**: javascript configuration file. This configuration must exists in the path `./app/config/{environment}.js`. Required.

**WARNING:**

To run the test yo must move on a e2e folder project. You can create it answer `Y' to the question
`Do you want an E2E project to be created? (Y/n)` in the creation app process.
See `cells app:create` above.


### <a name="app:serve"></a>app:serve

~~~
$ cells app:serve -c <environment_file>
~~~

Opens a server for a distribution type, with mocks/no mocks, and with a environment configuration.

Parameters:

- **type**: is the distribution type. Three possible values:
  - *novulcanize*: Generate a distribution no vulcanized in a new folder 'dist'.
  - *vulcanize*: Generate a distribution vulcanized in a new folder 'dist'.
  - *default*: Just generate temporal files likes css based in scss files.

- **environment_file**: is the configuration according environment type. This configuration must exists in the path `./app/config/{environment}.json`

- **mocks**: ask for open a server just for mocks. Values:
  - *mocks*: open the mocks server.
  - *nomocks*: Doesn't open the mocks server.

**WARNING:** To serve the test yo must be inside of a folder cells app. You can create it executing `cells app:create` and folowing its steps.
See `cells app:create` above.


### <a name="component:create"></a>component:create

~~~
$ cells component:create
~~~

Creates the scaffolding of a Cells component from scratch.

The component will have the following structure:

~~~
component-name/
    .editorconfig
    .gitignore
    README.md
    bower.json
    demo/
    index.html
    locales/
    test/
    component-name.html
    component-name.js
    component-name.scss
~~~

Parameters:
- **componentName**: must contain a hyphen

~~~

### <a name="component:serve"></a>component:serve

~~~
$ cells component:serve
~~~

This command serves your component locally, lints your javascript code and builds a polymer style component from your .scss files. It also watches for changes in your code to lint and build again when detected.

### <a name="component:lint"></a>component:lint

~~~
$ cells component:lint
~~~

Runs a lint validation on the source code of the component. It uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) as linter, applying a set of rules you can find in this [.eslintrc.json file](https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/projects/CTOOL/repos/cells-eslintrc/browse/.eslintrc.json).


### <a name="component:test"></a>component:test

~~~
$ cells component:test
~~~

Runs [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) unit tests in the component. **If all the tests pass**, then it executes a code coverage analysis based on [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).
